Hierarchical structure for Physical Inventories and sub-Inventories
===================================================================

This module adds a parent-child relationship between Physical Inventories, to
help users manage complex inventories.
Using several inventories, you can distribute the counting to several persons
and still keep a clear overview of global Inventory's status.

OpenERP will make sure the status of the Inventory and it's Sub-Inventories are
consistent.
