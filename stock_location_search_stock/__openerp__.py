Stock Location Search Stock Quantities
======================================

Add search functions on Products' Real and Virtual Stock on Stock Locations.

The "Stock by Location" view that is accessed from a product shows the
list of locations, each one with the Real and Virtual Stock for the
product. However, there is no way to filter out the locations which
doesn't contain the product so the view is cluttered with a lot of
lines with a 0.0 quantity. This module adds search functions on the quantity
fields.

Also, by default, a filter hides the locations without quantity at all.
