Procurement Auto Create Group
=============================

This module allows the system to propose automatically new procurement groups
in procurement orders.

This capability is important when you want to make sure that all the stock
moves resulting from this procurement will never be mixed with moves from
other groups in stock transfers.

The stock transfers resulting from the execution of these procurements will
only contain stock moves created from that procurement.


Installation
------------





Configuration
-------------






#. Go to *Inventory / Configuration / Settings* and check the option 'Advanced
   routing of products using rules' and press the 'Apply' button.
#. Activate the developer mode.
#. Go to *Inventory / Configuration / Routes / Routes* and check the option
   'Auto-create Procurement Group' to the pull rules where you want the
   procurement groups to be automatically proposed.

Usage
-----






=====

#. Go to *Inventory / Reports / Procurement Exceptions*.
#. Create a new procurement order and make sure that it determines a pull rule
   with the option 'Auto-create Procurement Group' set.
#. When you save the procurement order, a procurement group with format
   'PG/000001' will be created.
